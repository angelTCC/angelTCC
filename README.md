## Hi, I'm Angel - Applied Scientist 👋

- 🌱 I’m interested in understanding how things work and turning that knowledge into practical solutions. With a background in Physics and a focus on software and data analysis, I seek to apply technology in a simple and useful way. I value well-done work, continuous learning, and projects that create real impact.
